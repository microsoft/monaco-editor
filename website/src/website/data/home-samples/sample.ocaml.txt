  Welcome to the official OCaml Playground!

  You don't need to install anything - just write your code
  and see the results appear in the Output panel.

  This playground is powered by OCaml 5 which comes with
  support for shared-memory parallelism through domains and effects.
  Below is some naive example code that calculates
  the Fibonacci sequence in parallel.

  Happy hacking!

let num_domains = 2
let n = 20

let rec fib n =
  if n < 2 then 1
  else fib (n-1) + fib (n-2)

let rec fib_par n d =
  if d <= 1 then fib n
  else
    let a = fib_par (n-1) (d-1) in
    let b = Domain.spawn (fun _ -> fib_par (n-2) (d-1)) in
    a + Domain.join b

let () =
  let res = fib_par n num_domains in
  Printf.printf "fib(%d) = %d\n" n res

(*
  By the way, a much better, single-threaded implementation that calculates
  the Fibonacci sequence is this:

  let rec fib m n i =
    if i < 1 then m
    else fib n (n + m) (i - 1)

  let fib = fib 0 1

  For a more in-depth, realistic example of how to use
  parallel computation, take a look at
