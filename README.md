# Monaco CSS

CSS language plugin for the Monaco Editor. It provides the following features when editing CSS, LESS and SCSS files:
* Code completion
* Hovers
* Validation: Syntax errors and linting
* Find definition, references & highlights for symbols in the same file
* Document Symbols
* Color Decorators

Linting an be configured through the API. See [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/monaco-css/blob/master/src/monaco.d.ts) for the API that the
CSS plugin offers to configure the CSS/LESS/SCSS language support.

Internally the CSS plugin uses the [vscode-css-languageservice](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-css-languageservice)
node module, providing the implementation of the functionally listed above. The same module is also used
in [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode) to power the CSS, LESS and SCSS editing experience.
