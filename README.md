# Monaco Editor

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/ms/monaco-editor/_apis/build/status/microsoft.monaco-editor?label=website)](https://dev.azure.com/ms/monaco-editor/_build/latest?definitionId=3)

The Monaco Editor is the code editor which powers [VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode), with the features better described [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved).

Please note that this repository contains no source code for the code editor, it only contains the scripts to package everything together and ship the `monaco-editor` npm module.

## Try it out

Try the editor out [on our website](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/playground.html?source=v0.35.0)

## Installing

```
$ npm install monaco-editor
```

You will get:

- inside `esm`: ESM version of the editor (compatible with e.g. webpack)
- inside `dev`: AMD bundled, not minified
- inside `min`: AMD bundled, and minified
- inside `min-maps`: source maps for `min`
- `monaco.d.ts`: this specifies the API of the editor (this is what is actually versioned, everything else is considered private and might break with any release).

It is recommended to develop against the `dev` version, and in production to use the `min` version.

## Issues

## FAQ

❓ **What is the relationship between VS Code and the Monaco Editor?**

The Monaco Editor is generated straight from VS Code's sources with some shims around services the code needs to make it run in a web browser outside of its home.

❓ **What is the relationship between VS Code's version and the Monaco Editor's version?**

None. The Monaco Editor is a library and it reflects directly the source code.

❓ **I've written an extension for VS Code, will it work on the Monaco Editor in a browser?**

No.

> Note: If the extension is fully based on the [LSP](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) and if the language server is authored in JavaScript, then it would be possible.

❓ **Why all these web workers and why should I care?**

Language services create web workers to compute heavy stuff outside of the UI thread. They cost hardly anything in terms of resource overhead and you shouldn't worry too much about them, as long as you get them to work (see above the cross-domain case).

❓ **What is this `loader.js`? Can I use `require.js`?**

It is an AMD loader that we use in VS Code. Yes.

❓ **I see the warning "Could not create web worker". What should I do?**

HTML5 does not allow pages loaded on `file://` to create web workers. Please load the editor with a web server on `http://` or `https://` schemes.

❓ **Is the editor supported in mobile browsers or mobile web app frameworks?**

No.

❓ **Why doesn't the editor support TextMate grammars?**

- Please see https://github.com/bolinfest/monaco-tm which puts together `monaco-editor`, `vscode-oniguruma` and `vscode-textmate` to get TM grammar support in the editor.

❓ **What about IE 11 support?**

- The Monaco Editor no longer supports IE 11. The last version that was tested on IE 11 is `0.18.1`.
